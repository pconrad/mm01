# This is a custom about page

This whole page is an attempt by P. Conrad to try out the minimal mistakes
Jekyll theme.  I'm trying this out as an alternative to the home grown
stuff I've been doing for UCSB CS Course pages.

# Content below is from the demo

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.
